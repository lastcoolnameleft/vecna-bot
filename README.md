# vecna-bot
A D&amp;D bot using MS BotFramework.  I was going to call it the "Gaze-bot/Gazebo-t, after [my favorite D&D story](http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/98/Jul/gazebo.html), but was concerned the name wouldn't read well in text as it does in my head.

## Background

This bot is uses the [MS BotFramework](https://dev.botframework.com/) to build a simple D&D character builder.  It's not very impressive yet.  I haven't even told my mom about it.

## Prep

* Download and run the MS Bot Framework Emulator
  * https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/tools/bot-framework-emulator/
```
git clone git@github.com:lastcoolnameleft/vecna-bot.git
cd vecna-bot
npm install
```


## Run

```
npm run build-watch
npm run run-watch
```

* Start the Bot Framework Emulator
* Use the default settings
